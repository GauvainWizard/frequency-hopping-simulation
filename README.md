# frequency-hopping-simulation

Simulation of frequency hopping in GSM and E-GPRS for voice calls and data transmission.

## Setup the project

### Compile (not necessary)

The project was written entirely in TypeScript and must therefore be compiled in JavaScript. This step is not necessary, as all compiled files are already available in the project. You need to [install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
However, if you wish to compile, you'll need to execute
`npm install`
`tsc`

### Launching

To launch the project in local, you need to clone it
`git clone https://github.com/GauvainWizard/frequency-hopping-simulation.git`
You then need to start a web server in the source folder by using a tool like XAMPP or http-server, it's up to you.
Http-server is already installed if you did
`npm install`
So you can launch the project by typing
`http-server`

## Access the project

### Online

The project is available online at [Frequency Hopping Simulation](https://gauvainwizard.github.io/frequency-hopping-simulation/)
